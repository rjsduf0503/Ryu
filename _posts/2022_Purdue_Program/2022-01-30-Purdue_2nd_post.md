# 2nd post

### Topic

- Our project's topic is <b>"Finding optimal routes & fire emergency evacuation routes inside the building by using beacon"</b>.

### Current role

- I(Geonyeol Ryu) am in charge of <b>creating App</b>.
- Namho Kim is in charge of <b>bluetooth connection and server</b>.
- Minsu Sun is in charge of <b>image scanning & finding route</b>.
- Junseong Moon and Migyeong Kim are in charge of <b>IEEE & arduino</b>.

### Big goals we should achieve

1. Provide users with the fastest escape route in the event of a fire.
2. Act as indoor navigation in peacetime.

### What I did?

- Uploading building's blueprints for each floor.
- Signup & login
- Navigation stack
- Beacon detecting

### Difficulty

- It was my first time developing React Native, so it took a long time to study.
- I had difficulty connecting beacons to start a project only when I could connect them.
- As a result of experimenting with several packages, it was found that the react-native-kontaktio worked well.
