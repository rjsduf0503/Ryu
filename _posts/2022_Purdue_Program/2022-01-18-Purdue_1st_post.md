# 1st post

### Topic

- First, our project's topic is <b>"Finding optimal routes & fire emergency evacuation routes inside the building by using beacon"</b>.

### Current role

- I(Geonyeol Ryu) am in charge of <b>creating App</b>.
- Namho Kim is in charge of <b>bluetooth connection and server</b>.
- Minsu Sun is in charge of <b>image scanning</b>.
- Junseong Moon and Migyeong Kim are in charge of <b>IEEE & arduino</b>.

### Big goals we should achieve

1. Provide users with the fastest escape route in the event of a fire.
2. Act as indoor navigation in peacetime.

### How to?

- When the manager uploads a blueprint for each floor, the app converts it to a map, and the administrator enters the name of each room.
- Using a Bluetooth beacon, the user’s location data is obtained.
- In peacetime, the app shows an optimized route to the destination that the user wants.
- In the event of a fire, a fire alarm that is linked to the server notifies the server of the occurrence of the fire, and the server notifies the user of the fire through the app.
- And the app displays the current population cluster and the fastest escape route from the current user location on the map.
